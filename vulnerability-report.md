#Vulnerability Report

**Reviewer:** Claire Gatenby

**Date:** Feb 05, 2017

**Reviewing:** [Learning Journal](https://github.com/chamberi/pyramid-learning-journal)

##A1 - Injection
Injection flaws, such as SQL, OS, and LDAP injection occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker’s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

###Observations:
The Learning Journal was built using the Pyramid Framework. Pyramid uses an ORM manager for database queries, removing the use of raw sql from the code. 


##A2 - Broken Auth
Application functions related to authentication and session management are often not implemented correctly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users’ identities.

###Observations
The Learning Journal App does have log in but no admin or super users. There is also no page to register so that information isn't even exposed to the user.


##A3 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

XSS flaws occur whenever an application takes untrusted data and sends it to a web browser without proper validation or escaping. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim’s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.

###Observations
The only input field I could access was the login page which I wasn't able to use a script on. 


##A4 - Insecure Direct Object Reference (DOR)

A direct object reference is likely to occur when a developer exposes a reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file, directory, or database key without any validation mechanism which will allow attackers to manipulate these references to access unauthorized data.

### Observations

I tried to access the edit and new entry routes by manually typing in the URL but I was denied access with a 403 error page.

##A5 - Security Misconfiguration
Good security requires having a secure configuration defined and deployed for the application, frameworks, application server, web server, database server, and platform. Secure settings should be defined, implemented, and maintained, as defaults are often insecure. Additionally, software should be kept up to date.

###Exposure
When I logged in with an incorrect user it revealed that debug was still turned on I could see the source code which could give me access to senstive information.

### Repair
Turn debug off in the setup file.

##A6 - Sensitive Data Exposure
Many web applications do not properly protect sensitive data, such as credit cards, tax IDs, and authentication credentials. Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes. Sensitive data deserves extra protection such as encryption at rest or in transit, as well as special precautions when exchanged with the browser.

###Exposure
Again debugger is still turned on so sensitive information could be accessed via the method described above


##A8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
A CSRF attack forces a logged-on victim’s browser to send a forged HTTP request, including the victim’s session cookie and any other automatically included authentication information, to a vulnerable web application. This allows the attacker to force the victim’s browser to generate requests the vulnerable application thinks are legitimate requests from the victim.

###Observation:
CSRF protection has been inclued for any form making a POST request.
